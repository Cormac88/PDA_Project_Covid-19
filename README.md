# PDA_Project_Covid-19
Using statistics available about Ireland to simulate data about Covid-19

## Objectives of this Project

The objective of this project is to synthesise and simulate some data about Covid-19 cases using the NumPy Random package and basing this off real data from sources such as the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the HSE. The sample size will be 100 to start with and the variables that I will analyse will be:

- Age
- Gender
- Underlying Conditions
- Vaccination Status
- Hospitalisation
- Admission to ICU
- Death/Recovery

To breakdown this project and to start it, I am going to focus on the Age variable first. I will get some statistics from the web and get the age data simulated and put this into a Pandas DataFrame using NumPy. This has been achieved now along with simulating some data on gender. These statistics have been added to a pandas dataframe called `dfcovid`.

# Quick Steps

# Install

## Installing Python and Jupyter Notebook

1. Python and jupyter lab are needed to run the `.ipnb` files in this repository.

2. Download `Python` from https://www.python.org/.

3. Type `pip install jupyterlab` and press enter.

4. Wait for jupyter to finish installing.

Please see the [official Installation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) of Jupyter Lab page if you are having issues.

# Running the Code

1. Change directory to the folder that contains the.ipynb file you wish to run.

2. Type `jupyter lab`.

3. Jupyter lab will open in your browser as a new tab. Keep the command prompt window open as it needs to stay running while Jupyter Notebook is active.

4. Click on the `.ipynb` file you wish to run.

5. Click on `Kernel` and then select `Restart Kernal and Run All Cells`.

6. When finished, close the tab in your browser and then press press 'ctrl + C' in the command prompt to end the session.
